the 3 directories are ready to compile deb (src and bin).

In particular you can use them to:
- make install to get the proper tools (build)
- use dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot to make the bin deb
- use debuild -S -sa to make the src deb


deprecated:
- install ossec with the normal ./install.sh
- make deb to create the proper package

To build the deb src:
- maybe update ossec-hids-*-2.6.0/debian/changelog (with 'dch -i' command)
- copy the src directory from ossec-hids-2.6.tgz to debian/src
- have the gpg key
- debuild -S -sa to make the src deb

upload to launchpad:
* ossec-hids-*_2.6.0-ubuntu1.dsc
* ossec-hids-*_2.6.0.orig.tar.gz
* ossec-hids-*_2.6.0-ubuntu1.diff.gz

dput ppa:nicolas-zin/ossec-ubuntu <source.changes>

the 3 directories are ready to compile deb (src and bin).

In particular you can use them to:
- make install to get the proper tools (build)
- use dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot to make the bin deb
- use debuild -S -sa to make the src deb


deprecated:
- install ossec with the normal ./install.sh
- make deb to create the proper package
